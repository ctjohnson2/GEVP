this c++ code is still under development, but to compile one needs itpp libraries and gsl


fitter.py python script fits principle correlators just fine but is slow
fitter.m MATLAB script fits and plots single principle correlators, much faster
fitter C++ fits multiple simultaneously in openmp (this is the version called by python GEVP.py but one can change that)


meff.py effective mass computer for correlation function meff = log(C(3+t)/C(t))/-3
print_cov.py prints covariance matrix for principle correlator
